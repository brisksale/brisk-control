Fluture offers a control structure similar to Promises, Tasks, Deferreds, and
what-have-you. Let's call them Futures.

Much like Promises, Futures represent the value arising from the success or
failure of an asynchronous operation (I/O). Though unlike Promises, Futures are
*lazy* and adhere to [the *monadic* interface](#interoperability).

Some of the features provided by Fluture include:

* [Cancellation](#future).
* [Resource management utilities](#resource-management).
* [Stack safe composition and recursion](#stack-safety).
* Great integration with functional libraries such as [Sanctuary][S].
* A pleasant debugging experience through informative error messages.

## Usage

> `npm install --save fluture`

### In ES5 or older environments

Fluture depends on these functions being present:
[`Object.create`][JS:Object.create],
[`Object.assign`][JS:Object.assign] and [`Array.isArray`][JS:Array.isArray].
You may need to polyfill one or more.

<!-- eslint-disable no-var -->
```js
var fs = require('fs');
var Future = require('fluture');

var getPackageName = function(file){
  return Future.node(function(done){ fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', done) })
  .chain(Future.encase(JSON.parse))
  .map(function(x){ return x.name });
};

getPackageName('package.json')
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "fluture"
```

### In ES6 or newer environments

The `package.json` sets a `module`-field for build-tools like [Rollup][].

```js
import {readFile} from 'fs';
import {node, encase} from 'fluture';

const getPackageName = file =>
  node(done => { readFile(file, 'utf8', done) })
  .chain(encase(JSON.parse))
  .map(x => x.name);

getPackageName('package.json')
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "fluture"
```

## Documentation

### Type signatures

[Hindley-Milner][2] type signatures are used to document functions. Signatures
starting with a `.` refer to "static" functions, whereas signatures starting
with a `#` refer to functions on the prototype.

A list of all types used within the signatures follows:

- **Future** - Instances of Future provided by Fluture.
- **Promise** - Values which conform to the [Promises/A+ specification][7].
- **Functor** - Values which conform to the [Fantasy Land Functor specification][FL:functor]
  as determined by [Sanctuary Type Classes][Z:Functor].
- **Bifunctor** - Values which conform to the [Fantasy Land Bifunctor specification][FL:bifunctor]
  as determined by [Sanctuary Type Classes][Z:Bifunctor].
- **Chain** - Values which conform to the [Fantasy Land Chain specification][FL:chain]
  as determined by [Sanctuary Type Classes][Z:Chain].
- **Apply** - Values which conform to the [Fantasy Land Apply specification][FL:apply]
  as determined by [Sanctuary Type Classes][Z:Apply].
- **Iterator** - Objects with `next`-methods which conform to the [Iterator protocol][3].
- **Iteration** - `{done, value}`-Objects as defined by the [Iterator protocol][3].
- **Next** - An incomplete (`{done: false}`) Iteration.
- **Done** - A complete (`{done: true}`) Iteration.
- **Cancel** - The nullary cancellation functions returned from computations.

### Stack safety

Fluture interprets your transformations in a stack safe way. This means that
none of the following operations raise `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`:

```js
const add1 = x => x + 1;
let m = Future.of(1);
for(let i = 0; i < 100000; i++){
  m = m.map(add1);
}

m.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 100001
```

```js
const m = (function recur(x){
  const mx = Future.of(x + 1);
  return x < 100000 ? mx.chain(recur) : mx;
}(1));

m.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 100001
```

### Creating Futures

#### Future
##### `Future :: ((a -> (), b -> ()) -> Cancel) -> Future a b`

Creates a Future with the given computation. A computation is a function which
takes two callbacks. Both are continuations for the computation. The first is
`reject`, commonly abbreviated to `rej`. The second `resolve`, which abbreviates
to `res`. When the computation is finished (possibly asynchronously) it may call
the appropriate continuation with a failure or success value.

```js
Future(function computation(reject, resolve){
  //Asynchronous work:
  const x = setTimeout(resolve, 3000, 'world');
  //Cancellation:
  return () => clearTimeout(x);
});
```

Additionally, the computation may return a nullary function containing
cancellation logic. This function is executed when the Future is cancelled
after it's [forked](#fork).

#### of
##### `.of :: a -> Future _ a`

Creates a Future which immediately resolves with the given value. This function
is compliant with the [Fantasy Land Applicative specification][FL:applicative].

```js
const eventualThing = Future.of('world');
eventualThing.fork(
  console.error,
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//> "Hello world!"
```

#### reject
##### `.reject :: a -> Future a _`

Creates a Future which immediately rejects with the given value. Just like `of`
but for the rejection branch.

#### after
##### `.after :: Number -> b -> Future a b`

Creates a Future which resolves with the given value after n milliseconds.

```js
const eventualThing = Future.after(500, 'world');
eventualThing.fork(console.error, thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`));
//> "Hello world!"
```

#### rejectAfter
##### `.rejectAfter :: Number -> a -> Future a b`

Creates a Future which rejects with the given reason after n milliseconds.

```js
const eventualError = Future.rejectAfter(500, new Error('Kaputt!'));
eventualError.fork(err => console.log('Oh no - ' + err.message), console.log);
//! Oh no - Kaputt!
```

#### cache
##### `.cache :: Future a b -> Future a b`

Returns a Future which caches the resolution value of the given Future so that
whenever it's forked, it can load the value from cache rather than reexecuting
the chain.

```js
const {readFile} = require('fs');
const eventualPackage = Future.cache(
  Future.node(done => {
    console.log('Reading some big data');
    readFile('package.json', 'utf8', done);
  })
);

eventualPackage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Reading some big data"
//> "{...}"

eventualPackage.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "{...}"
```

#### do
##### `.do :: (() -> Iterator) -> Future a b`
##### `.go :: (() -> Iterator) -> Future a b`

A specialized version of [fantasy-do][4] which works only for Futures, but has
the advantage of type-checking and not having to pass `Future.of`. Another
advantage is that the returned Future can be forked multiple times, as opposed
to with a general `fantasy-do` solution, where forking the Future a second time
behaves erroneously.

Takes a function which returns an [Iterator](#type-signatures), commonly a
generator-function, and chains every produced Future over the previous.

This allows for writing sequential asynchronous code without the pyramid of
doom. It's known as "coroutines" in Promise land, and "do-notation" in Haskell
land.

```js
Future.do(function*(){
  const thing = yield Future.after(300, 'world');
  const message = yield Future.after(300, 'Hello ' + thing);
  return message + '!';
})
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//After 600ms:
//> "Hello world!"
```

Error handling is slightly different in do-notation, you need to [`fold`](#fold)
the error into your control domain, I recommend folding into an [`Either`][S:Either]:

```js
const attempt = Future.fold(S.Left, S.Right);
const ajaxGet = url => Future.reject('Failed to load ' + url);
Future.do(function*(){
  const e = yield attempt(ajaxGet('/message'));
  return S.either(
    e => `Oh no! ${e}`,
    x => `Yippee! ${x}`,
    e
  );
})
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Oh no! Failed to load /message"
```

This function has an alias `go`, for environments in which `do` is a reserved word.

#### try
##### `.try :: (() -> !a | b) -> Future a b`
##### `.attempt :: (() -> !a | b) -> Future a b`

Creates a Future which resolves with the result of calling the given function,
or rejects with the error thrown by the given function.

Sugar for `Future.encase(f, undefined)`.

```js
const data = {foo: 'bar'};
Future.try(() => data.foo.bar.baz)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> [TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined]
```

This function has an alias `attempt`, for environments in which `try` is a reserved word.

#### encase
##### `.encase :: (a -> !e | r) -> a -> Future e r`
##### `.encase2 :: (a, b -> !e | r) -> a -> b -> Future e r`
##### `.encase3 :: (a, b, c -> !e | r) -> a -> b -> c -> Future e r`

Takes a function and a value, and returns a Future which when forked calls the
function with the value and resolves with the result. If the function throws
an exception, it is caught and the Future will reject with the exception:

```js
const data = '{"foo" = "bar"}';
Future.encase(JSON.parse, data)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [SyntaxError: Unexpected token =]
```

Partially applying `encase` with a function `f` allows us to create a "safe"
version of `f`. Instead of throwing exceptions, the encased version always
returns a Future when given the remaining argument(s):

```js
const data = '{"foo" = "bar"}';
const safeJsonParse = Future.encase(JSON.parse);
safeJsonParse(data).fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [SyntaxError: Unexpected token =]
```

Furthermore; `encase2` and `encase3` are binary and ternary versions of
`encase`, applying two or three arguments to the given function respectively.

#### encaseP
##### `.tryP` :: (a -> Promise e r) -> Future e r
##### `.encaseP :: (a -> Promise e r) -> a -> Future e r`
##### `.encaseP2 :: (a, b -> Promise e r) -> a -> b -> Future e r`
##### `.encaseP3 :: (a, b, c -> Promise e r) -> a -> b -> c -> Future e r`

Allows Promise-returning functions to be turned into Future-returning functions.

Takes a function which returns a Promise, and a value, and returns a Future.
When forked, the Future calls the function with the value to produce the Promise,
and resolves with its resolution value, or rejects with its rejection reason.

```js
const fetchf = Future.encaseP(fetch);

fetchf('https://api.github.com/users/Avaq')
.chain(res => Future.tryP(_ => res.json()))
.map(user => user.name)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Aldwin Vlasblom"
```

Furthermore; `encaseP2` and `encaseP3` are binary and ternary versions
of `encaseP`, applying two or three arguments to the given function respectively.

#### node
##### `.node :: (((a, b) -> ()) -> ()) -> Future a b`

Creates a Future which rejects with the first argument given to the function,
or resolves with the second if the first is not present.

This is a convenience for NodeJS users who wish to easily obtain a Future from
a node style callback API. To permanently turn a function into one that returns
a Future, check out [futurization](#futurization).

```js
const {readFile} = require('fs');
Future.node(done => readFile('package.json', 'utf8', done))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "{...}"
```

### Transforming Futures

#### map
##### `#map :: Future a b ~> (b -> c) -> Future a c`
##### `.map :: Functor m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b`

Transforms the resolution value inside the Future, and returns a new Future with
the transformed value. This is like doing `promise.then(x => x + 1)`, except
that it's lazy, so the transformation will not be applied before the Future is
forked. The transformation is only applied to the resolution branch: If the
Future is rejected, the transformation is ignored. To learn more about the exact
behaviour of `map`, check out its [spec][FL:functor].

```js
Future.of(1)
.map(x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2
```

#### bimap
##### `#bimap :: Future a b ~> (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> Future c d`
##### `.bimap :: Bifunctor m => (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> m a c -> m b d`

Maps the left function over the rejection value, or the right function over the
resolution value, depending on which is present.

```js
Future.of(1)
.bimap(x => x + '!', x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2

Future.reject('error')
.bimap(x => x + '!', x => x + 1)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "error!"
```

#### chain
##### `#chain :: Future a b ~> (b -> Future a c) -> Future a c`
##### `.chain :: Chain m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b`

Allows the creation of a new Future based on the resolution value. This is like
doing `promise.then(x => Promise.resolve(x + 1))`, except that it's lazy, so the
new Future will not be created until the other one is forked. The function is
only ever applied to the resolution value; it's ignored when the Future was
rejected. To learn more about the exact behaviour of `chain`, check out its [spec][FL:chain].

```js
Future.of(1)
.chain(x => Future.of(x + 1))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 2
```

#### swap
##### `#swap :: Future a b ~> Future b a`
##### `.swap :: Future a b -> Future b a`

Resolve with the rejection reason, or reject with the resolution value.

```js
Future.of(new Error('It broke')).swap().fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [It broke]

Future.reject('Nothing broke').swap().fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "Nothing broke"
```

#### mapRej
##### `#mapRej :: Future a b ~> (a -> c) -> Future c b`
##### `.mapRej :: (a -> b) -> Future a c -> Future b c`

Map over the **rejection** reason of the Future. This is like `map`, but for the
rejection branch.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke!'))
.mapRej(err => new Error('Some extra info: ' + err.message))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! [Some extra info: It broke!]
```

#### chainRej
##### `#chainRej :: Future a b ~> (a -> Future a c) -> Future a c`
##### `.chainRej :: (a -> Future a c) -> Future a b -> Future a c`

Chain over the **rejection** reason of the Future. This is like `chain`, but for
the rejection branch.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke!')).chainRej(err => {
  console.error(err);
  return Future.of('All is good');
})
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "All is good"
```

#### fold
##### `#fold :: Future a b ~> (a -> c, b -> c) -> Future _ c`
##### `.fold :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Future a b -> Future _ c`

Applies the left function to the rejection value, or the right function to the
resolution value, depending on which is present, and resolves with the result.

This provides a convenient means to ensure a Future is always resolved. It can
be used with other type constructors, like [`S.Either`][S:Either], to maintain a
representation of failures:

```js
Future.of('hello')
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Right('hello')

Future.reject('it broke')
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Left('it broke')
```

### Combining Futures

#### ap
##### `#ap :: Future a (b -> c) ~> Future a b -> Future a c`
##### `.ap :: Apply m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b`

Applies the function contained in the left-hand Future or Apply to the value
contained in the right-hand Future or Apply. If one of the Futures rejects the
resulting Future will also be rejected.

```js
Future.of(x => y => x + y)
.ap(Future.of(1))
.ap(Future.of(2))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> 3
```

Note that even though `#ap` does *not* conform to the latest [spec][FL:apply],
the hidden `fantasy-land/ap`-method *does*. Therefore Future remains fully
compliant to Fantasy Land.

#### and
##### `#and :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b`
##### `.and :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b`

Logical and for Futures.

Returns a new Future which either rejects with the first rejection reason, or
resolves with the last resolution value once and if both Futures resolve. This
behaves analogously to how JavaScript's *and*-operator does.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->
```js
//An asynchronous version of:
//isResolved() && getValue();
isResolved().and(getValue());
```

```js
//Asynchronous "all", where the resulting Future will be the leftmost to reject:
const all = ms => ms.reduce(Future.and, Future.of(true));
all([Future.after(20, 1), Future.of(2)]).value(console.log);
//> 2
```

#### or
##### `#or :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b`
##### `.or :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b`

Logical or for Futures.

Returns a new Future which either resolves with the first resolution value, or
rejects with the last rejection value once and if both Futures reject. This
behaves analogously to how JavaScript's *or*-operator does.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->
```js
//An asynchronous version of:
//planA() || planB();
planA().or(planB());
```

```js
//Asynchronous "any", where the resulting Future will be the leftmost to resolve:
const any = ms => ms.reduce(Future.or, Future.reject('empty list'));
any([Future.reject(1), Future.after(20, 2), Future.of(3)]).value(console.log);
//> 2
```

### Resource management

Functions listed under this category allow for more fine-grained control over
the flow of acquired values.

#### hook
##### `.hook :: Future a b -> (b -> Future a c) -> (b -> Future a d) -> Future a d`

Allows a Future-returning function to be decorated with resource acquistion
and disposal. The signature is like `hook(acquire, dispose, consume)`, where
`acquire` is a Future which might create connections, open file handlers, etc.
`dispose` is a function that takes the result from `acquire` and should be used
to clean up (close connections etc) and `consume` also takes the result from
`acquire`, and may be used to perform any arbitrary computations using the
resource. The resolution value of `dispose` is ignored.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->
```js
const withConnection = Future.hook(
  openConnection('localhost'),
  closeConnection
);

withConnection(
  conn => query(conn, 'EAT * cakes FROM bakery')
)
.fork(console.error, console.log);
```

In the case that a hooked Future is *cancelled* after the resource was acquired,
`dispose` will be executed and immediately cancelled. This means that rejections
which may happen during this disposal are **silently ignored**. To ensure that
resources are disposed during cancellation, you might synchronously dispose
resources in the `cancel` function of the disposal Future:

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->
```js
const closeConnection = conn => Future((rej, res) => {

  //We try to dispose gracefully.
  conn.flushGracefully(err => {
    if(err === null){
      conn.close();
      res();
    }else{
      rej(err);
    }
  });

  //On cancel, we force dispose.
  return () => conn.close();

});
```

#### finally
##### `#finally :: Future a b ~> Future a c -> Future a b`
##### `#lastly :: Future a b ~> Future a c -> Future a b`
##### `.finally :: Future a c -> Future a b -> Future a b`
##### `.lastly :: Future a c -> Future a b -> Future a b`

Run a second Future after the first settles (successfully or unsuccessfully).
Rejects with the rejection reason from the first or second Future, or resolves
with the resolution value from the first Future.

```js
Future.of('Hello')
.finally(Future.of('All done!').map(console.log))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "All done!"
//> "Hello"
```

Note that the *first* Future is given as the *last* argument to `Future.finally()`:

```js
const program = S.pipe([
  Future.of,
  Future.finally(Future.of('All done!').map(console.log)),
  Future.fork(console.error, console.log)
]);

program('Hello');
//> "All done!"
//> "Hello"
```

As with [`hook`](#hook); when the Future is cancelled before the *finally
computation* is running, the *finally computation* is executed and immediately
cancelled.

This function has an alias `lastly`, for environments in which `finally` is a reserved word.

### Consuming Futures

#### fork
##### `#fork :: Future a b ~> (a -> (), b -> ()) -> Cancel`
##### `.fork :: (a -> ()) -> (b -> ()) -> Future a b -> Cancel`

Execute the computation that was passed to the Future at [construction](#future)
using the given `reject` and `resolve` callbacks.

```js
Future.of('world').fork(
  err => console.log(`Oh no! ${err.message}`),
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//> "Hello world!"

Future.reject(new Error('It broke!')).fork(
  err => console.log(`Oh no! ${err.message}`),
  thing => console.log(`Hello ${thing}!`)
);
//> "Oh no! It broke!"

const consoleFork = Future.fork(console.error, console.log);
consoleFork(Future.of('Hello'));
//> "Hello"
```

After you `fork` a Future, the computation will start running. If you wish to
cancel the computation, you may use the function returned by `fork`:

```js
const fut = Future.after(300, 'hello');
const cancel = fut.fork(console.error, console.log);
cancel();
//Nothing will happen. The Future was cancelled before it could settle.
```

#### value
##### `#value :: Future a b ~> (b -> ()) -> Cancel`
##### `.value :: (b -> ()) -> Future a b -> Cancel`

Extracts the value from a resolved Future by forking it. Only use this function
if you are sure the Future is going to be resolved, for example; after using
`.fold()`. If the Future rejects and `value` was used, an (likely uncatchable)
`Error` will be thrown.

```js
Future.reject(new Error('It broke'))
.fold(S.Left, S.Right)
.value(console.log);
//> Left([Error: It broke])
```

Just like [fork](#fork), `value` returns the `Cancel` function:

```js
Future.after(300, 'hello').value(console.log)();
//Nothing will happen. The Future was cancelled before it could settle.
```

#### promise
##### `#promise :: Future a b ~> Promise b a`
##### `.promise :: Future a b -> Promise b a`

An alternative way to `fork` the Future. This eagerly forks the Future and
returns a Promise of the result. This is useful if some API wants you to give it
a Promise. It's the only method which forks the Future without a forced way to
handle the rejection branch, so I recommend against using it for anything else.

```js
Future.of('Hello').promise().then(console.log);
//> "Hello"
```

### Parallelism

#### race
##### `#race :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b`
##### `.race :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b`

Race two Futures against each other. Creates a new Future which resolves or
rejects with the resolution or rejection value of the first Future to settle.

```js
Future.after(100, 'hello')
.race(Future.after(50, 'bye'))
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "bye"

const first = futures => futures.reduce(Future.race, Future.never);
first([
  Future.after(100, 'hello'),
  Future.after(50, 'bye'),
  Future.rejectAfter(25, 'nope')
])
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//! "nope"
```

#### both
##### `#both :: Future a b ~> Future a b -> Future a b`
##### `.both :: Future a b -> Future a b -> Future a b`

Run two Futures in parallel. Basically like calling
[`Future.parallel`](#parallel) with exactly two Futures:

```js
const a = Future.of('a');
const b = Future.of('b');

Future.both(a, b).fork(console.error, console.log);
//> ['a', 'b']
```

#### parallel
##### `.parallel :: PositiveInteger -> Array (Future a b) -> Future a (Array b)`

Creates a Future which when forked runs all Futures in the given `array` in
parallel, ensuring no more than `limit` Futures are running at once.

```js
const tenFutures = Array.from(Array(10).keys()).map(Future.after(20));

//Runs all Futures in sequence:
Future.parallel(1, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 200ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

//Runs upto five Futures in parallel:
Future.parallel(5, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 40ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

//Runs all Futures in parallel:
Future.parallel(Infinity, tenFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//after about 20ms:
//> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

If you want to settle all Futures, even if some may fail, you can use this in
combination with [fold](#fold):

```js
const instableFutures = Array.from({length: 4}, (_, i) =>
  Future.node(done => done(Math.random() > 0.75 ? 'failed' : null, i))
);

const stabalizedFutures = instableFutures.map(Future.fold(S.Left, S.Right));

Future.parallel(Infinity, stabalizedFutures).fork(console.error, console.log);
//> [ Right(0), Left("failed"), Right(2), Right(3) ]
```

#### ConcurrentFuture
##### `.Par :: Future a b -> ConcurrentFuture a b`
##### `.seq :: ConcurrentFuture a b -> Future a b`

ConcurrentFuture (or `Par` for short) is the result of applying
[`concurrify`][concurrify] to `Future`. It provides a mechanism for constructing
a [Fantasy Land `Alternative`][FL:alternative] from a member of `Future`. This
allows Futures to benefit from the Alternative Interface, which includes
parallel `ap`, `zero` and `alt`.

The idea is that you can switch back and forth between `Future` and
`ConcurrentFuture`, using `Par` and `seq`, to get sequential or concurrent
behaviour respectively. It's useful if you want a purely algebraic alternative
to [`parallel`](#parallel) and [`race`](#race).

```js
const {of, ap, zero, alt, sequence} = require('sanctuary');
const {Future, Par, seq} = require('fluture');

//Some dummy values
const x = 1;
const f = a => a + 1;

//The following two are equal ways to construct a ConcurrentFuture
const parx = of(Par, x);
const parf = Par(of(Future, f));

//We can make use of parallel apply
seq(ap(parx, parf)).value(console.log);
//> 2

//Or concurrent sequencing
seq(sequence(Par, [parx, parf])).value(console.log);
//> [x, f]

//Or racing with alternative
seq(alt(zero(Par), parx)).value(console.log);
//> 1
```

### Utility functions

#### isFuture
##### `.isFuture :: a -> Boolean`

Returns true for [Futures](#type-signatures) and false for everything else. This
function (and [`S.is`][S:is]) also return `true` for instances of Future that
were created within other contexts. It is therefore recommended to use this over
`instanceof`, unless your intent is to explicitly check for Futures created
using the exact `Future` constructor you're testing against.

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-expressions -->
```js
const Future1 = require('/path/to/fluture');
const Future2 = require('/other/path/to/fluture');
const noop = () => {};

const m1 = Future1(noop);
Future1.isFuture(m1) === (m1 instanceof Future1);
//> true

const m2 = Future2(noop);
Future1.isFuture(m2) === (m2 instanceof Future1);
//> false
```

#### never
##### `.never :: Future a a`

A Future that never settles. Can be useful as an initial value when reducing
with [`race`](#race), for example.

#### isNever
##### `.isNever :: a -> Boolean`

Returns `true` if the given input is a `never`.

### Sanctuary

When using this module with [Sanctuary Def][$] (and [Sanctuary][S] by
extension) you might run into the following issue:

```js
const S = require('sanctuary');
const Future = require('fluture');
S.I(Future.of(1));
//! Since there is no type of which all the above values are members,
//! the type-variable constraint has been violated.
```

This happens because Sanctuary Def needs to know about the Future type in order
to determine whether the variable types are consistent.

To let Sanctuary know about Futures, we can provide it a `FutureType` using
[`BinaryType`][$:BinaryType] from Sanctuary Def, and pass it to Sanctuary using
[`S.create`][S:create]:

```js
const $ = require('sanctuary-def');
const Future = require('fluture');
const {env, create} = require('sanctuary');

const FutureType = $.BinaryType(
  Future.name,
  'https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture#future',
  Future.isFuture,
  Future.extractLeft,
  Future.extractRight
);

const S = create({checkTypes: true, env: env.concat([FutureType])});

S.I(Future.of(1));
//> Future.of(1)
```

### Futurization

To reduce the boilerplate of making Node or Promise functions return Futures
instead, one might use the [Futurize][1] library:

```js
const Future = require('fluture');
const futurize = require('futurize').futurize(Future);
const readFile = futurize(require('fs').readFile);
readFile('README.md', 'utf8')
.map(text => text.split('\n'))
.map(lines => lines[0])
.fork(console.error, console.log);
//> "# [![Fluture](logo.png)](#butterfly)"
```

### Casting Futures

Sometimes you may need to convert one Future to another, for example when the
Future was created by another package, or an incompatible version of Fluture.

When [`isFuture`](#isfuture) returns `false`, a conversion is necessary. Usually
the most concise way of doing this is as follows:

```js
const NoFuture = require('incompatible-future');
const incompatible = NoFuture.of('Hello');

//Cast the incompatible Future to our version of Future:
const compatible = Future(incompatible.fork.bind(incompatible));

compatible.both(Future.of('world')).value(console.log);
//> ["Hello", "world"]
```

## Butterfly

The name "Fluture" is a conjunction of "FL" (the acronym to [Fantasy Land][FL])
and "future". Fluture means butterfly in Romanian: A creature you might expect
to see in Fantasy Land.
